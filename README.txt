Hi there! 

Welcome to my little project on trying to increase Machine Learning Literacy. 
I hope you stay a bit, get your foot into this wonderful technology and create great things. 

Just to help you navigate a bit (I apologize, this is the first time I have done something like this):

The file you are looking for is called presentation.ipynb. It is a jupyter notebook, with comments describing exactly what is going on. 
Along with that are some images to better understand what's going on. They are referred to in the notebook, so please do take a look at them. 
They are not mine and were sourced from google.

The data was collected by Jacek Czerniak, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences.
More details are here in the form of a pdf in the directory of the notebook and in the .names file located with the data.

And finally, an extremely sloppily made machine learning algorithm was also added called "examplecodewithouttensorflow.py". 
As the name suggests, this file is there to merely prove that a tailor-made api is not needed in many scenarios, and can in many cases be faster!
